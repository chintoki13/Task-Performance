<p style="font-family: courier;">Many people often questioned about my choice, why I choose medicine as my major and my career in the future. Everyone knows that Medicine is difficult and expensive major yet takes the longest time compared to other majors in the university. That is the fact that we canâ€™t ignore. Regardless of that, everyone has their own calling in life. They will give their best effort not only because of that calling, but also their passion and so am I.</p>
